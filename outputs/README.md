Put your results bundle here. Include evidence for **both** domains:

## Aircraft (required)
- route/trajectory output (CSV/JSON) and/or a plot
- constraint checks summary (geofence violations = 0, energy respected, etc.)
- performance metrics (time, energy, success rate)

## Spacecraft (required)
- 7-day schedule output (CSV/JSON/table)
- contact/visibility evidence
- constraint checks summary (pointing/power proxy feasibility)
- mission value metrics (observations successfully downlinked)
